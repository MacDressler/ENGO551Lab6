I used chatGPT to code it, with the command:

"Hello, I have a new lab. Please read this entire prompt, and create an html file to complete this task. 

In this lab, you’ll learn about using Turf.js to add line simplification to your web mapping applications. You will be allowing a user to draw a polyline. And when a user clicks on a “simplify button”, the map will show a simplified version of the polyline drew by the user in a different color.

Getting Started
Turf.js
Turf.js has a Simplify function you can use. In fact it is based on Simplify.js.

Requirements
Alright here are the requirements:

Map: When a user visits the site, the user should be able to draw a polyline on the map.
Analysis: When a user clicks on a button on the frontend, the map will then show a simplified line of the polyline drawn by the user. There should be the other button on the frontend, so that the user is able to remove the polyline from the map and draw a new polyline.
You can use any mapping library of your choice."
